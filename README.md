# ip-lookup-C
##### IP lookup is  a task of routing performing that checking the routing table in order to find the most matched prefix of IP Address.
##### It is the longest match prefix in the routing table.
##### It always cares about memory access times and memory storage.
##### In the class, It has been introduced many algorithms to perform this task.
##### I decide to use Radix Trie to implement IP lookup with C.
